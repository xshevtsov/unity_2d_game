# "Fool the conductor" 2D Unity game gameplay

The player's goal is to avoid being caught by the conductor while collecting "passenger" coins, each adding 100 points to their score. Similarly, each coin collected by the conductor also contributes 100 points to their score. The game follows a cyclical pattern, with the bus continuously moving forward from one stop to the next indefinitely. When the bus comes to a stop, any remaining coins are collected by the conductor.
